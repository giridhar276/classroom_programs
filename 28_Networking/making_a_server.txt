Making a server :
=========================

A server has a bind() method which binds it to a specific ip and port so that it can listen to incoming requests on that ip and port. 


Next a server has a listen() method which puts the server into listen mode. This allows the server to listen to incoming connections. 


And lastly a server has an accept() and close() method. The accept method initiates a connection with the client and the close method closes the connection with the client.
