The Difference Between XML and HTML
===================================

XML and HTML were designed with different goals:

XML was designed to carry data - with focus on what data is
HTML was designed to display data - with focus on how data looks
XML tags are not predefined like HTML tags are



XML stands for EXtensible Markup Language
XML is a markup language much like HTML
XML was designed to store and transport data
XML was designed to be self-descriptive


XML is a software- and hardware-independent tool for storing and transporting data.

XML plays an important role in many IT systems.

For this reason, it is important for all software developers to have a good understanding of XML.
